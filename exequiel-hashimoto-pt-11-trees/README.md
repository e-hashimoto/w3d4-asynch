# Finding the left-most node at each level

Your objective is to find the left-most node at each level of a
binary tree.  Note, this is a binary tree, but it is **not** a binary search
tree.  This isn't a factor for this problem, but nodes will not be organized
with smaller on the left and large on the right.

1. Clone the assessment repository from the button below.
2. Rename the folder to `your-name-pt-11-trees`
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. Fill out code in `tree_project.js`
4. Uncomment the marked code and run `node tree_project.js` to run local test
   cases
5. `npm test` to run the test specs

## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. Delete the `node_modules` directory
2. Zip up your renamed folder
3. Upload it
